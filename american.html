        <p>Alan Wake's American Nightmare was a game created by Remedy in 2012, simply 2 years after the first game in the style of an arcade game,
        it was made to add more detail to the story of the series and to introduce a character who would be of great importance in Alan Wake 2 being Scratch.</p>
        <p>The story of the game is Alan being stuck in a loop of fighting against the main antagonist Scratch, who is another version of Alan being controlled by the Darkness, without being able to remember it but over the course of the
        game Alan is able to remember more and more through the loops and is able to save people that Scratch was planning to kill. Over the course of the game you go to many areas with some examples being an observatory, a diner and a motel with each area that you go through having people and animals controlled by Scratch trying to stop Alan from stopping Scratch's plans.
        Each time you go through a loop Alan is more experienced and knowledgeable so he is able to go faster and faster to each area to find the equipment he needs to stop Scratch and escape the loop that he is trapped in.
        With the game being in an arcade style you find weapons that you can switch to over the areas, with more enemies to fight than the other 2 games you can sometimes barely get a break from the fighting.
        At the end of the game you defeat Scratch in a drive-in movie theatre after going through enough loops to get all the equipment and information needed to figure out what is going on and the way to beat him. </p>
