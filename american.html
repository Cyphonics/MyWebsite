                    Alan Wake's American Nightmare was a game released by Remedy in 2012, simply 2 years after the first
                    game in the style of an arcade game, it was made to add more detail to the story of the series and
                    to introduce a character who would be of great importance in Alan Wake 2 being Scratch.

                    The story of the game is Alan being stuck in a loop of fighting against the main antagonist Scratch,
                    who is another version of Alan being controlled by the Darkness, without being able to remember it
                    but over the course of the game Alan is able to remember more and more throughout the loops and is
                    able to save people that Scratch was planning to kill. Over the course of the game you go to many
                    areas with some examples being an observatory, a diner and a motel with each area that you go
                    through having people and animals controlled by Scratch trying to prevent Alan from stopping
                    Scratch's plans. Each time you go through a loop Alan is more experienced and knowledgeable so he is
                    able to go faster and faster to each area to find the equipment he needs to stop Scratch and escape
                    the loop that he is trapped in. With the game being in an arcade style you find weapons that you can
                    switch to over the areas, with more enemies to fight than the other 2 games you can sometimes barely
                    get a break from the fighting. At the end of the game you defeat Scratch in a drive-in movie theatre
                    after going through enough loops to get all the equipment and information needed to figure out what
                    is going on and the way to beat him.
