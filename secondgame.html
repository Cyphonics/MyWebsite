                The story starts with Saga Anderson and Alex Casey starting to investigate a series of muders in Bright
                Falls. The murders are thought to be done by a cult of serial killers using the bodies for sacrificial
                rituals as the victims are always missing their hearts. Over the course of the game you learn more about
                the cult as you find letters and emails that they are sending to eachother. As you try to figure out who
                the cult is you find Alan Wake who has been missing for 13 years lying on a beach confused about where
                he is. After you find Alan you start to play as him in the Dark Place which is a seperate dimension
                connected to the Bright Falls area trying to escape, however while playing as Alan you learn that the
                order of events happening is wrong and that you are experiencing events that have already happened for
                Saga. It is revealed towards the end of the game that everyone is stuck in a spiral of events that are
                repeating and affect other parts of time which explains why the events you experience as Saga and Alan
                happen at different times for the both of them. The way that you play and fight against the darkness is
                the same as the other games.
