        <h1>The Spiral</h1>
        <p> Alan Wake 2 was a game created by Remedy Entertainment in 2023, the story of the game revolves around the titular character Alan Wake, the
        deuteragonist Saga Anderson and the tritagonist Alex Casey. </p>
        <P>The story starts with Saga Anderson and Alex Casey starting to investigate a group of cult murders in the town of Bright Falls.
        The murders are being done by a cult who at the beginning you think are working for Scratch as you fight against members protected by Darkness but over the course of the game you learn that they are actually trying to stop the Darkness and Scratch and some members are simply being taken over.
        The stories of Alan and Saga start to overlap when Saga finds Alan on part of a beach after he esapes the Dark Place where he was stuck for 13 years in a loop he never remembered.
        Over the course of the game you play as Saga in the real world trying to figure out what is happening and help Alan and you play as Alan in the dark place trying to escape and return to the real world.
        Towards the end of the game you learn that the entire story is stuck in a spiral with a ritual that Saga does at the end letting Alan out of the Dark Place days earlier.</P>
