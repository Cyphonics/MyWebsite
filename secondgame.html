        <h1>The Spiral</h1>
        <p> Alan Wake 2 was a game created by Remedy Entertainment in 2023, the story of the game revolves around the titular character Alan Wake, the
        deuteragonist Saga Anderson and the tritagonist Alex Casey. </p>
        <P>The story starts with Saga Anderson and Alex Casey starting to investigate a group of cult murders in the town of Bright Falls.
        The murders are being done by a group who at the beginning you think are working for Scratch as you fight against members protected by Darkness but over the course of the game you learn that they are actually trying to stop the Darkness and Scratch and some members are simply being taken over.
        The stories of Alan and Saga start to overlap when Saga finds Alan on part of a beach after he esapes the Dark Place where he was stuck for 13 years</P>
