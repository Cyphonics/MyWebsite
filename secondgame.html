        <p>
            Alan Wake 2 was a game released by Remedy Entertainment in 2023, the story of the game revolves around the
            titular character Alan Wake, the deuteragonist Saga Anderson and the tritagonist Alex Casey.
        </p>
        <p>The story starts with Saga Anderson and Alex Casey starting to investigate a series of muders in Bright Falls. The murders
        are thought to be done by a cult of serial killers using the bodies for sacrificial rituals as the victims are always missing their hearts.
        Over the course of the game you learn more about the cult as you find letters and emails that they are sending to eachother. As you try to figure out who the cult is you find Alan Wake who has been missing for 13 years
        lying on a beach confused about where he is. After you find Alan you start to play as him in the Dark Place which is a seperate dimension connected to the Bright Falls area trying to escape, however while playing as Alan you learn that the order of events happening is wrong and that you are experiencing events that have already happened for Saga.
        It is revealed towards the end of the game that everyone is stuck in a spiral of events that are repeating and affect other parts of time which explains why the events you experience as Saga and Alan happen at different times for the both of them. The way that you play and fight against the darkness is the same as the other games.  </p>
