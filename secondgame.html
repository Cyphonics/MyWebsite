                    The story starts with Saga Anderson and Alex Casey starting to investigate a series of muders in
                    Bright Falls. The murders are thought to be done by a cult of serial killers using the bodies for
                    sacrificial rituals as the victims are always missing their hearts. Over the course of the game you
                    learn more about the cult as you find letters and emails that they are sending to eachother. As you
                    try to figure out who the cult is you find Alan Wake who has been missing for 13 years lying on a
                    beach confused about where he is. After you find Alan you start to play as him in the Dark Place
                    which is a seperate dimension connected to the Bright Falls area trying to escape, however while
                    playing as Alan you learn that the order of events happening is wrong and that you are experiencing
                    events that have already happened for Saga. It is revealed towards the end of the game that everyone
                    is stuck in a spiral of events that are repeating and affect other parts of time which explains why
                    the events you experience as Saga and Alan happen at different times for the both of them. The way
                    that you play and fight against the darkness is the same as the other games.
