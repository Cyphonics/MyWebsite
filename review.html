                    I loved playing the Alan Wake series of games as they had so much story to experience and think
                    about as you go through the games. The amount of detail put in these games is incredible as they
                    needed to think about how to fit the manuscript pieces that you find in to the areas that you go
                    through.

                    I loved the first game of the series as it was a unique experience that I don't think I have ever
                    experienced before.

                    I didn't enjoy American Nightmare as much because it didn't feel like it fit in with the other games
                    in the series.

                    I thought Alan Wake 2 was a masterpiece of a game that had a lot of love and thought put in to it.

                    I have not finished the dlc for both control and Alan Wake 2 however so far, I do not enjoy the
                    control dlc as much as the main game.

                    These are my thoughts on whether or not to play the main games and a score that I would give them.
