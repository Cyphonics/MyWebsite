            <p>
                I loved playing the Alan Wake series of games as they had so much story to experience and think about as
                you go through the games. The amount of detail put in these games is incredible as they needed to think
                about how to fit the manuscript pieces that you find in to the areas that you go through.
            </p>
            <p>
                I loved the first game of the series as it was a unique experience that i don't think i have ever
                experienced
            </p>
            <p>
                I didn't enjoy American Nightmare as much because it didn't feel like it fit in with the other games in
                the series.
            </p>
            <p>I thought Alan Wake 2 was a masterpiece of a game that had a lot of love and thought put in to it.</p>
            <p>
                I have not finished the dlc for both control and Alan Wake 2 however so far I do not enjoy the control
                dlc as much as the main game.
            </p>
            <p>These are my thoughs on whether or not to play the games and a score that i would give them.</p>
