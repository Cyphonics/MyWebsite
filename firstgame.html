        <h1>Where it began</h1>
        <p> Alan Wake was a game created in 2010 by Remedy Entertainment, the story of the game revolves around the titular character Alan Wake
        trying to take a break from writing books by going to a town called bright falls for a vacation with his wife. His vacation is interrupted when the darkness which is an ancient presence takes control of him 
        and forces him to write a story that then starts to turn into reality through the powers it possesses. </p>
        <p>As you go through the game you find pieces of the story that Alan was forced to write by the Darkness and as the story is coming true
        the pieces that you find actually tells you about events that have either happened already or events that you are going to encounter later on.
        It is revealed over the course of the game that this has all happened before with more artists with the main one you learn about being
        Thomas Zane who tried to use the mystical powers of Cauldron Lake to bring his wife back to life. As he was trying to use the powers of the lake he accidentally released the Darkness that tried to control him, however he managed to send it back to where it came from at the price of most traces of him disappearing.
            It is unknown however if Thomas was the one who created the darkness using the powers of the lake or if it had existed before him and he simply released it and it used him.
        The enemies that you fight against in the game are people that the darkness has taken over to stop you from being able to reach the only object able to harm it.
        The way that you fight against the enemies is to use your flashlight to weaken the Darkness protecting them and to shoot and kill them.</p>
