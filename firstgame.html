                    Alan Wake was a game released in 2010 by Remedy Entertainment, the story of the game revolves around
                    the titular character Alan Wake trying to take a break from writing books by going to a town called
                    bright falls for a vacation with his wife. His vacation is interrupted when the darkness, which is
                    an ancient presence, takes control of him and forces him to write a story that then starts to turn
                    into reality through the powers it possesses.

                    As you go through the game you find pieces of the story that Alan was forced to write by the
                    Darkness and as the story is coming true the pieces that you find tell you about events that have
                    either happened already or events that you are going to encounter later on. It is revealed over the
                    course of the game that this has all happened before with other artists with the main one you learn
                    about being Thomas Zane who tried to use the mystical powers of Cauldron Lake to bring his wife back
                    to life. As he was trying to use the powers of the lake he accidentally released the Darkness that
                    tried to take control of him, however he managed to send it back to where it came from at the price
                    of most traces of him disappearing from the world. It is unknown however if Thomas was the one who
                    created the darkness using the powers of the lake or if it had existed before him and he simply
                    released it and it used him. The enemies that you fight against in the game are people that the
                    darkness has taken over to stop you from being able to reach the only object able to harm it. The
                    way that you fight against the enemies is to use your flashlight to weaken the Darkness protecting
                    them and to shoot and kill them.
